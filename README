COMPILATION
===========

The software is built using cmake. To compile create a build
subdirectory.  Switch to this directory and call 'cmake ../' and
make. The binaries are compiled to the ./bin directory in the base
dir.

You may simply copy this:
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make
> cd ../bin 

REQUIRED LIBRARIES
==================

  + OpenGL
  + glut
  + BOOST Filesystem
  + BOOST Program Option
  + BOOST System
  + BOOST Thread
  + Qt 4.6 or higher for viewer
  + libQGLViewer 2.3.9 or newe for qglviewer
  + librply ( https://github.com/lkiesow/librply )
 (+) libxi6 (debian, maybe +additional headers and dev files)
 (+) libxmu6 (debian, maybe +additional headers and dev files)

USAGE
=====

Your can experiment with the software using the provided dataset. For
a simple reconstruction call

> ./bin/reconstruct -v 100 dat/scan.pts

in the root directory of the project. This will create a file called
'traingle_mesh.ply' which can be displayed using the viewer
application:

> ./bin/viewer triangle_mesh.ply

Alternatively you can use the qviewer application to view the
file. This program uses libqglviewer to visualize the generated
triangle meshes. It will only be built, if libQGLViewer 2.3.9 or newer
was detected on your system.

> ./bin/qviewer 

For more information, build the Doxygen documentation by calling 'make
doc' in the build directory.
