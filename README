COMPILATION
===========

The software is built using cmake. To compile create a build subdirectory.
Switch to this directory and call 'cmake ../' and make. The binaries are
compiled to the ./bin directory in the base dir.

You may simply copy this:
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make
> cd ../bin

installed):

> yum install boost-build boost-devel boost-static boost-thread cmake doxygen \
	freeglut-devel gcc gcc-c++ libQGLViewer libQGLViewer-devel \

USAGE
=====

Your can experiment with the software using the provided dataset. For a simple
reconstruction call

> ./bin/reconstruct -v 100 ../data/flur1.pts

in the root directory of the project. This will create a file called 'mesh.ply'
which can be displayed using the viewer application:

> ./bin/viewer mesh.ply
